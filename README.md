# whatsapp-php
whatsapp-php is a lightweight PHP implementation for making WhatsApp API calls. This repository provides a straightforward codebase for sending messages using the WhatsApp API.
I've designed it to be a great starting point for developers who are looking to incorporate WhatsApp messaging functionality into their PHP applications.
